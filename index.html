						<p>
							Espresso is coffee brewed by forcing a small amount of nearly boiling water under pressure through finely ground coffee beans. Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods, has a higher concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and has crema on top (a foam with a creamy consistency).
						</p>

						<p>
						Tamping down the coffee promotes the water's even penetration of the grounds. This process produces an almost syrupy beverage by extracting both solid and dissolved components. The "crema" is produced by emulsifying the oils in the ground coffee into a colloid, which does not occur in other brewing methods.

							Fingerprint login on phones? I don't know about you, but that freaks me out. I don't want a thief running off with my phone and a finger. Phones are relatively easy to come by; replacement body parts, not so much.
						</p>
						<p>
						Plus, I like all of my fingers. I've had them for a long time and I got used to them being there. I don't have a favorite one, they're all useful.
						</p>
						<p>
						Can you imagine the trouble of tacking on a different finger? I mean, where do you even go to get replacement fingers?
